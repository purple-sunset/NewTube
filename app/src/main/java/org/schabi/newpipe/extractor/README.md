NewPipe Extractor
=================

This is the system independent core of [NewPipe](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe).
It can be used to create your own java based NewPipe client.

A small exmaple showing how this extractor can be used can be found [here](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/np-cli).
